    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A random number generator is a system that generates random numbers from a true source of randomness. Often something physical, such as a Geiger counter, where the results are turned into random numbers. We do not need true randomness in machine learning. Instead we can use [pseudorandomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator). Pseudorandomness is a sample of numbers that look close to random, but were generated using a deterministic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Shuffling data and initializing coefficients with random values use pseudorandom number generators. These little programs are often a function that you can call that will return a random number. Called again, they will return a new random number. Wrapper functions are often also available and allow you to get your randomness as an integer, floating point, within a specific distribution, within a specific range, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The numbers are generated in a sequence. The sequence is deterministic and is seeded with an initial number. If you do not explicitly seed the pseudorandom number generator, then it may use the current system time in seconds or milliseconds as the seed.\n",
