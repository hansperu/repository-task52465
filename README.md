## 1. Random numbers in NumPy
### What is a random number?
In this notebook I will respond and discuss the following points:

### Explain the general purpose of the package.
It is a Python package, specialized for building and manipulating large and multidimensional arrays. NumPy has built-in functions for linear algebra and random number generation. It is an important library because many of the other Python packages such as SciPy, Matplotlib rely on Numpy to work (to a reasonable degree).

The numpy.random module supplements Python's built-in random with functions to efficiently generate complete arrays of sample values from many types of probability distributions. Python source for data analysis by Wes McKinney.

In the file **1. Random numbers in NumPy.ipynb** we develop and explain in detail the Numpy random numbers.

## 2. What is Simple Random data fuction?
In this section we will develop the Simple Random Data function and generate random numbers of different types, such as matrices of various shapes, normally distributed matrices, ranges of floats of different parameters such as the range, dimensions and probabilities of the returned values.

The file **2.Simple random data and Permutations.ipynb** demonstrates the utility of the random.rand function to generate random numbers between 0 and 1 and how this data can be manipulated, plotted, and displayed.

## 3. What is data distribution?
The data distribution is a list of all possible values and the frequency with which each value occurs. These lists are important when working with statistics and data science.

The random module offers methods that return randomly generated data distributions.

Normal distributions are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. The normal distribution is a continuous theoretical probability distribution.

The **3.Distributions funtions.ipynb** file explains the use and purpose of at least five "Distributions" functions.

## 4. Generate Random Numbers in Python

The use of randomness is an important part of configuring and evaluating machine learning algorithms.

From randomly initializing weights in an artificial neural network to dividing data into test sets and random trains, shuffling a set of stochastic gradient descent training data, generating random numbers, and taking advantage of randomness is a skill. necessary.

File **4. Using seeds to generate pseudorandom numbers.ipynb** explains the use of seeds to generate pseudorandom numbers.
