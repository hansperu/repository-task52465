## Random numbers in NumPy
### What is a random number?
In this notebook I will respond and discuss the following points:

#### 1. Explain the general purpose of the package.
It is a Python package, specialized for building and manipulating large and multidimensional arrays. NumPy has built-in functions for linear algebra and random number generation. It is an important library because many of the other Python packages such as SciPy, Matplotlib rely on Numpy to work (to a reasonable degree).

The numpy.random module supplements Python's built-in random with functions to efficiently generate complete arrays of sample values from many types of probability distributions. Python source for data analysis by Wes McKinney.

In the file **1. Random numbers in NumPy.ipynb** we develop and explain in detail the Numpy random numbers.

## What is Simple Random data fuction?
In this section we will develop the Simple Random Data function and generate random numbers of different types, such as matrices of various shapes, normally distributed matrices, ranges of floats of different parameters such as the range, dimensions and probabilities of the returned values.

The file **2.Simple random data and Permutations** demonstrates the utility of the random.rand function to generate random numbers between 0 and 1 and how this data can be manipulated, plotted, and displayed.
